# Reqnroll.Actions

*Note: The Reqnroll Actions have been ported from the SpecFlow.Actions package to make the SpecFlow-Reqnroll migration easier as `Reqnroll.SpecFlowCompatibility.Actions.*` (e.g. `Reqnroll.SpecFlowCompatibility.Actions.Selenium`). They might be revised and updated later and moved to Reqnroll.Actions. See related [discussion topic](https://github.com/orgs/reqnroll/discussions/34) for details.*

Reqnroll Actions are our new way to help you all write easier and quicker test automation. They will solve common challenges you encounter during your work of automating an application/API/website/mobile app/microservice/

There will be two kinds of Reqnroll Actions: 

## 1. Code Snippets
These are small code snippets that solve a particular problem, which can be easily copy-pasted and adapted to your needs. 

You can find a list of all Code Snippets [here](./CodeSnippets/Readme.md).

## 2. Plugins
For more complex problems, there will be dedicated plugins for Reqnroll that provide more functionalities and integrate effortlessly into Reqnroll and its features.

You can find a list of all Plugins [here](./Plugins/README.md).
